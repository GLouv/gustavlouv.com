# Site Style Guide
Design philosophy: minimal, timeless, content-first.  
The writing and structure *are* the design; visuals only reinforce clarity.

- Layout grid: 8 px spacing system, generous whitespace.  
- Rounded corners: xl, soft shadows, 0.1 opacity.  
- Motion: subtle fades only; respect prefers-reduced-motion.  
- Typography: Inter or Neue Montreal, 16–18 px base, line height 1.6–1.8.  
- Palette: white / graphite / electric blue #0785FF.  
- Imagery: documentary-style photography — no stock art or illustrations.  
- Components: clean cards, generous padding, consistent border-radius.  
- Build for clarity, calm, and credibility — *never decoration*.
