            I'm Gustav Louv. I build AI systems that automate how companies sell.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Six months ago, I founded <strong>Agent360</strong>—the Nordic AI sales infrastructure. 
            We're building voice agents that understand context, navigate complexity, and close deals. 
            Not chatbots. Not scripts. Systems that think.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4 text-graphite-900">Early Days: Sales Floors</h2>
        
        <p>
            Before 25, I closed <strong>8,000+ electricity contracts</strong>. Door-to-door, cold calls, 
            objection handling—the full grind. I learned what actually moves people to buy: 
            context, timing, and trust.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Sales isn't about talking faster. It's about listening better and responding with precision. 
            That insight became the foundation for everything I'd build later.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4 text-graphite-900">Tenerife: First Ventures</h2>
        
        <p>
            I moved to Tenerife and started experimenting with business models—small ventures, 
            rapid iteration, learning what worked and what didn't. The goal wasn't scale yet. 
            It was understanding how to build systems that generated value without constant manual input.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4 text-graphite-900">The EcommerceBot Saga</h2>
        
        <p>
            Then came <strong>EcommerceBot</strong>. Built it with a co-founder. Market validation looked good. 
            Then the hostage situation hit—my co-founder held the codebase and infrastructure hostage. 
            Everything locked down overnight.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I moved to <strong>San Francisco</strong> to rebuild. Found a new co-founder. Pivoted the product 
            toward Shopify. Learned hard lessons about partnerships, control, and resilience. 
            The rebuild worked, but the experience taught me more about what <em>not</em> to do than what to do.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4 text-graphite-900">The AI Shift</h2>
        
        <p>
            During the rebuild, I saw where the world was heading. AI wasn't a feature—it was the infrastructure. 
            Sales teams weren't going to keep scaling linearly with headcount. The winners would be the ones 
            who built <strong>AI-native sales systems</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I started focusing full-time on AI. Not the hype. Not the demos. The actual engineering required 
            to make agents that could sell at scale. Context-aware. Tool-equipped. Adaptive.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4 text-graphite-900">Agent360: Now</h2>
        
        <p>
            Six months ago, I founded <strong>Agent360</strong>. We're building the top AI-powered sales voice 
            solution in the Nordics. Our agents understand local nuance, regulatory requirements, and buyer behavior.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The mission: <strong>automate how the Nordics sell</strong>. Not replace salespeople—make exceptional 
            performance repeatable. Turn individual mastery into scalable infrastructure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We're early, but the trajectory is clear. The next decade of sales belongs to the operators 
            who build the best AI systems. That's what we're doing.
